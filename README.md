# User Stories

- First-time visitor

- Returning visitor

- Frequent user

## Strategy
This game was created with the intent to catch the attention of anyone who comes across this game.
The targeted audience of this game is to everyone and all ages looking to improve their math skills that has some time to pass whether it is a quick lunch break or a breather just wanting to challenge themselves.
It is a simple game and easily understandable

## Scope
The Game will:
- Accept user input
- Create a random math equations
- Ask the user what the answer is to the equation
- Evaluate if the answer is correct
- Increment the score if the answer was correct
- after the rounds are complete prompt the user if they would like to play again

## Structure
The game will be structured with user experience in mind, it will have simple user prompts and guidance

- The score has a typewriter effect
- The "Do you want to play gain" has a typewriter effect
- The WebApp is designed to prevent any unwanted input from the user that is not required and will prompt them to enter a valid input
- The WebApp will randomize math equations for the user as many as the amount of rounds the user wants to play
- The math equations will be in the format of “y operator x”
- Every random equation that is created the “x” value is evaluated first if x is 0 it will remove the option divide “/” from the random operators so you can not get a math equation that will divide by 0 for example “2 / 0”

## Future Features
Add a signup where there will be set range values with a timer to answer to answer the math equations that will display your score on a scoreboard so you can challenge your peers
